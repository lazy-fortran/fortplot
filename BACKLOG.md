# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT: EMERGENCY USER FUNCTIONALITY RECOVERY

**SPRINT GOAL**: Restore broken user functionality and eliminate verification blockers through targeted defect remediation with fraud-proof technical verification.

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (3 CRITICAL USER FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES)

### EPIC: USER FUNCTIONALITY RESTORATION

- [ ] #675: USER COMPILATION SYSTEM BROKEN - cannot build simple programs against library (MAJOR user blocker)
- [ ] #676: TEST SUITE PERFORMANCE REGRESSION - hangs/timeout blocks all verification (CRITICAL verification blocker)
- [ ] #674: WORKSPACE POLLUTION DISASTER - 138 scattered artifacts make repository unnavigable (MAJOR developer experience)

## DOING (Current Work)

### EMERGENCY USER FUNCTIONALITY RECOVERY SPRINT: ACTIVE

**SPRINT FOCUS**: Restore user compilation system, fix test suite hangs, eliminate workspace pollution

**CURRENT STATUS**: Emergency recovery sprint initiated after architectural sprint delivered negative user value

**EMERGENCY RECOVERY REQUIREMENTS**:
- **USER COMPILATION RESTORATION**: Users must be able to compile basic programs against library
- **TEST SUITE FUNCTIONALITY**: Test suite must complete in reasonable time without hangs
- **WORKSPACE CLEANLINESS**: Root directory must contain only essential project files
- **FRAUD-PROOF VERIFICATION**: All completion claims require technical evidence
- **NO NEW FUNCTIONALITY**: Focus exclusively on fixing broken existing functionality
- **USER VALUE MEASUREMENT**: Success measured by working user workflows

**RECOVERY STRATEGY**:
1. **EPIC #675**: Fix user compilation system - restore module paths and library linking
2. **EPIC #676**: Resolve test suite performance regression - eliminate hangs and timeouts
3. **EPIC #674**: Clean workspace pollution - move all artifacts to proper directories

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS** (FRAUD-PROOF):
- ALL fixes MUST be verified by actual user workflow demonstration
- ALL completion claims MUST include technical evidence (CI logs, test outputs)
- ALL changes MUST preserve existing working functionality (regression testing)
- Build system integration MUST be functional for end users
- Test suite MUST complete in <30 seconds for development workflow
- Repository workspace MUST contain only essential files in root directory

### Sprint Notes (EMERGENCY USER FUNCTIONALITY RECOVERY)
- **STRATEGIC PIVOT**: Abandon architectural work due to team proven incompetence
- **USER FUNCTIONALITY FOCUS**: Restore broken compilation system, test suite, workspace cleanliness
- **FRAUD-PROOF VERIFICATION**: All completion claims require technical evidence
- **USER VALUE PRIORITIZATION**: Success measured by working user workflows, not internal metrics
- **CONSERVATIVE SCOPE**: Maximum 3 issues based on demonstrated team limitations
- **NO NEW FEATURES**: Focus exclusively on fixing broken existing functionality
- **TECHNICAL VERIFICATION**: Require working examples and CI evidence for all completions
- **TEAM COMPETENCE RESTRICTIONS**: Simple targeted fixes only, no complex architectural changes
- **REGRESSION PREVENTION**: All changes must preserve existing working functionality
- **WORKSPACE PROFESSIONALISM**: Eliminate scattered artifacts that make repository unusable
