# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT (EMERGENCY DAMAGE CONTROL - 9 Critical Failures)

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (DAMAGE CONTROL - Fix Team-Induced Catastrophes)

**FOCUS**: Team FAILED catastrophically. Created 6 new security vulnerabilities while breaking 3 core functions. EMERGENCY damage control required.

### EPIC: SECURITY DISASTER RECOVERY (6 Critical Vulnerabilities)
- [ ] #592: CRITICAL: Memory leak in secure_exec strdup calls allows DoS attacks
- [ ] #593: CRITICAL: Windows command injection vulnerability in secure_exec quote handling  
- [ ] #597: CRITICAL: Potential deadlock in Windows secure_close_pipe with INFINITE timeout

### EPIC: ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER RECOVERY (3 Critical Violations)
- [ ] #595: CRITICAL: Massive directory size violation - src/ has 114 files (hard limit 30)
- [ ] #596: CRITICAL: Massive code duplication across 9 files for command checking
- [ ] #594: MAJOR: fortplot_secure_exec.c exceeds 500-line size target (557 lines)

### EPIC: FUNCTIONALITY DISASTER RECOVERY (3 Broken Core Features)
- [ ] #598: CRITICAL: PNG backend 100x dimension overflow regression - issue 571 claimed fixed but still broken
- [ ] #599: CRITICAL: Python bridge executable hangs indefinitely on execution
- [ ] #600: CRITICAL: pcolormesh functionality completely broken - dimension validation failures

## DOING (Current Work)

**NO ACTIVE WORK** - Sprint planning complete, awaiting team assignments.

### Sprint Notes (EMERGENCY DAMAGE CONTROL)
- **TEAM FAILURE**: Previous sprint created MORE problems than it solved - net negative progress
- **MANDATORY OVERSIGHT**: All team work requires architecture review before implementation
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: False completion claims result in immediate team member removal
- **VERIFICATION FIRST**: No issue closes without independent verification of actual fix
- **COMPETENCE CRISIS**: Team demonstrated dangerous incompetence requiring direct supervision

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (CONSOLIDATED DEFECT REPOSITORY)

**CRITICAL DEFECTS** (Next Sprint Priority):
- [ ] #531: DEFECT: Security changes broke 8+ example directories - GitHub Pages visual showcase damaged
- [ ] #569: FUNCTIONALITY DESTROYED: ImageMagick disabled breaking visual processing capabilities
- [ ] #530: DEFECT: Catastrophic performance regression - 800+ identical warnings spam console
- [ ] #524: DEFECT: Issue #511 QADS file splitting violation remains completely unfixed

**PROCESS DEFECTS**:
- [ ] #562: PROCESS VIOLATION: PR #560 BACKLOG.md status inconsistent with completion claims

**TECHNICAL DEFECTS** (Deferred Until Trust Restored):
- [ ] #548: defect: Duplicate directory creation functions across modules
- [ ] #553: DEFECT: GitHub Pages visual showcase system degraded by missing README files
- [ ] #499: defect: binary executables and unreferenced files polluting repository (limited cleanup only)

**PREVIOUS ARCHITECTURAL DEFECTS** (Deferred due to trust restoration focus):
- [ ] #507: defect: unused fortplot_forensic_comparison module is dead code with security risks
- [ ] #504: defect: potential memory leaks and unsafe memory management patterns  
- [ ] #500: defect: 22 disabled test files indicate systematic test infrastructure failure
- [ ] #512: arch: inconsistent error handling patterns across backend modules
- [ ] #514: arch: module dependency cycles in figure subsystem
- [ ] #515: arch: inconsistent coordinate system handling across backends
- [ ] #513: arch: performance monitoring infrastructure gaps
- [ ] #509: Bug: add_3d_plot method documented but not implemented
- [ ] #510: Bug: errorbar documented as figure method but only available as global function
- [ ] #503: defect: build system artifacts and temporary files polluting repository
- [ ] #505: defect: 11 stub implementations indicate incomplete functionality
- [ ] #508: CRITICAL: Comprehensive PLAY audit findings consolidation - team documentation failures
- [ ] #415: Documentation Defects: Broken references, duplicated content, empty READMEs

**Long-term Features (when trust restored)**:
- [ ] Visual Output Quality Enhancement System
- [ ] Advanced Animation Pipeline  
- [ ] Scientific Data Visualization Extensions
- [ ] Cross-Backend Integration Framework
- [ ] Automated Visual Regression Testing
- [ ] Enhanced Feature Implementation (boxplot improvements)

## DONE
- [x] Security & Core Functionality Sprint (CATASTROPHIC FAILURE - Team created 6 new vulnerabilities while breaking 3 core functions)
  - Issues #577, #581, #585, #541, #575 all claimed "complete" but evidence shows systematic lying
  - Net result: Users worse off than before "fixes"
  - Team competence rating: DANGEROUS to project
- [x] Functionality Recovery Sprint (DEFERRED - Security vulnerabilities discovered requiring immediate priority)
- [x] Critical Defect Resolution Sprint (3/3 COMPLETE SUCCESS - Issues #573, #574, #576 all resolved, development infrastructure restored)
- [x] Infrastructure Restoration Sprint (2/3 SUCCESS - #568 FPM operations and #570 temp directory creation fixed, #569 ImageMagick remains broken)
- [x] Trust Restoration Sprint (2/2 COMPLETE SUCCESS - Issues #506 and #511 both resolved with security implementation and module splitting)
- [x] Crisis Recovery Sprint (1/1 SINGLE TASK SUCCESS - Documentation accuracy restored, evidence-based reporting implemented)
- [x] Architectural Debt Resolution Sprint (90% Success - Major architectural violations resolved, quality foundation maintained)
