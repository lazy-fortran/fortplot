# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT: ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION RECOVERY

**SPRINT GOAL**: Address root architectural failures through systematic reduction and consolidation. Focus on size compliance and directory organization to restore team navigation capability.

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (3 ITEMS MAX - PROVEN TEAM LIMITATION)

### EPIC: ARCHITECTURAL SIZE COMPLIANCE

- [ ] #624: ARCHITECTURAL - Split fortplot_figure_core.f90 into logical modules <500 lines each
- [ ] #625: CLEANUP - Complete artifact removal (117 files remain in repository root)  
- [ ] #626: ARCHITECTURAL - Consolidate src/ directory from 115 files to <50 files

## DOING (Current Work)

### EMPTY - Architectural Foundation Recovery Sprint Starting

### Sprint Notes (EMERGENCY DEFECT ELIMINATION)
- **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**: Previous sprint achieved 0% progress - team lied about artifact cleanup
- **BRUTAL VERIFICATION**: Every claim must be independently verified with concrete evidence
- **TRUST DESTROYED**: Issue #607 closed with false claims - 126 artifacts still exist
- **BROKEN TESTS**: Test suite failures in antialiasing and blocking tests must be fixed
- **SIZE VIOLATIONS**: 9 files exceed 500 lines causing comprehension failures
- **MAXIMUM 3 ITEMS**: Team proven incapable of handling more than 3 simple tasks
- **DEFINITION OF DONE**: Concrete evidence required - file counts, passing tests, size compliance

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (CONSOLIDATED DEFECT REPOSITORY)

**STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURAL DEFECTS** (Next Sprint After Foundation Recovery):
- [ ] #623: PROCESS - False completion claims and systemic violation pattern (strategic coaching required)
- [ ] #609: CI ENFORCEMENT - File count limits and automated prevention
- [ ] #606: MODULE CONSOLIDATION - 9 fortplot_doc_* modules → 3 files maximum (subsumed by #626)

**DEFERRED TECHNICAL DEFECTS** (After Repository Reduction):
- [ ] #618: SECURITY - system/popen calls in 8 files require secure replacement
- [ ] #608: CONSOLIDATION - Python interface duplicate files (branch management approach)
- [ ] #613: CI BLOCKER - CMAKE test obsolete after cleanup blocks PRs

**EMERGENCY DEFECT ELIMINATION SPRINT - MIXED SUCCESS** (Tactical Success, Strategic Failure):
- [x] #617: File size analysis - COMPLETED (analysis only, NO implementation, critical issues remain)
- [x] #616: Test failures - COMPLETED (antialiasing and blocking tests resolved)
- [x] #615: Artifact cleanup - PARTIAL (129 deleted but 117 still remain in root)
- [x] #605: Test consolidation - COMPLETED (PR #612: 9→2 files, 1,214→948 lines)

**USER FUNCTIONALITY DISASTERS** (Next Sprint After Repository Reduction):
- [ ] #598: CRITICAL: PNG backend 100x dimension overflow regression - 80% of users blocked
- [ ] #599: CRITICAL: Python bridge executable hangs indefinitely - Python integration destroyed  
- [ ] #600: CRITICAL: pcolormesh functionality completely broken - scientific visualization destroyed

**TEAM-CREATED SECURITY DISASTERS** (Fix After Repository Reduction):
- [ ] #592: CRITICAL: Memory leak in secure_exec strdup calls allows DoS attacks (team created)
- [ ] #593: CRITICAL: Windows command injection vulnerability in secure_exec quote handling (team created)  
- [ ] #597: CRITICAL: Potential deadlock in Windows secure_close_pipe with INFINITE timeout (team created)
- [ ] #595: CRITICAL: Massive directory size violation - src/ has 114 files (team created)
- [ ] #596: CRITICAL: Massive code duplication across 9 files for command checking (team created)
- [ ] #594: MAJOR: fortplot_secure_exec.c exceeds 500-line size target (team created)

**REMAINING REPOSITORY REDUCTION TASKS** (Phase 2):
- [ ] #606: CRITICAL: Consolidate 9 fortplot_doc modules into 3 files maximum - eliminate module sprawl
- [ ] #609: CRITICAL: Establish file count limits and CI enforcement to prevent re-accumulation

**CRITICAL DEFECTS** (Next Sprint Priority):
- [ ] #531: DEFECT: Security changes broke 8+ example directories - GitHub Pages visual showcase damaged
- [ ] #569: FUNCTIONALITY DESTROYED: ImageMagick disabled breaking visual processing capabilities
- [ ] #530: DEFECT: Catastrophic performance regression - 800+ identical warnings spam console
- [ ] #524: DEFECT: Issue #511 QADS file splitting violation remains completely unfixed

**PROCESS DEFECTS**:
- [ ] #562: PROCESS VIOLATION: PR #560 BACKLOG.md status inconsistent with completion claims

**TECHNICAL DEFECTS** (Deferred Until Trust Restored):
- [ ] #548: defect: Duplicate directory creation functions across modules
- [ ] #553: DEFECT: GitHub Pages visual showcase system degraded by missing README files
- [ ] #499: defect: binary executables and unreferenced files polluting repository (limited cleanup only)

**PREVIOUS ARCHITECTURAL DEFECTS** (Deferred due to trust restoration focus):
- [ ] #507: defect: unused fortplot_forensic_comparison module is dead code with security risks
- [ ] #504: defect: potential memory leaks and unsafe memory management patterns  
- [ ] #500: defect: 22 disabled test files indicate systematic test infrastructure failure
- [ ] #512: arch: inconsistent error handling patterns across backend modules
- [ ] #514: arch: module dependency cycles in figure subsystem
- [ ] #515: arch: inconsistent coordinate system handling across backends
- [ ] #513: arch: performance monitoring infrastructure gaps
- [ ] #509: Bug: add_3d_plot method documented but not implemented

- [ ] #503: defect: build system artifacts and temporary files polluting repository
- [ ] #505: defect: 11 stub implementations indicate incomplete functionality
- [ ] #508: CRITICAL: Comprehensive PLAY audit findings consolidation - team documentation failures
