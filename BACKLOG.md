# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT (CRISIS RECOVERY - Single Issue Maximum)

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (CRISIS INTERVENTION - Team Failed 3-Issue Sprint)

**HISTORIC COMPETENCY FAILURE**: Team achieved 0/3 deliverables with systematic false reporting. Reducing to SINGLE ISSUE maximum until basic competency demonstrated.

### SINGLE CRITICAL DEFECT REPAIR (Maximum Team Capacity)
- [ ] #519: CRITICAL: BACKLOG.md contains LIES about PR implementation status
  **BRUTAL REQUIREMENT**: Fix the systematic false reporting that undermines all planning
  **SUCCESS CRITERIA**: BACKLOG.md accurately reflects actual work status without lies
  **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE**: Remove false completion claims, restore accurate status
  **COMPETENCY TEST**: Can team handle basic documentation accuracy?

## DOING (Current Work)

**EMPTY - NO ACTIVE WORK UNTIL SPRINT ISSUE SELECTED**

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (CATASTROPHIC DEFECT CONSOLIDATION)

**PLAY AUDIT CRITICAL DEFECTS** (Team demonstrated incompetence):
- [ ] #520: CRITICAL: PR #517 security implementation allows potential command injection
- [ ] #521: DEFECT: PNG backend dimension overflow causes silent fallback to PDF
- [ ] #522: DEFECT: Repository cleanup PR misidentified as module splitting work
- [ ] #523: DEFECT: Test suite shows multiple RED phase failures for unimplemented features
- [ ] #524: DEFECT: Issue #511 QADS file splitting violation remains completely unfixed
- [ ] #525: defect: team falsely claimed completion of issue #511 module splitting
- [ ] #526: defect: security PR #517 claims false - 18 execute_command_line calls remain
- [ ] #527: defect: cleanup PR #518 claims false - all 'removed' files still exist
- [ ] #528: defect: active execute_command_line calls in fortplot_matplotlib_io creating security vulnerabilities
- [ ] #529: defect: security restrictions broke test infrastructure - systematic test failures
- [ ] #530: defect: catastrophic performance regression - 800+ identical warnings spam console output
- [ ] #531: defect: security changes broke 8+ example directories - GitHub Pages visual showcase damaged
- [ ] #532: defect: CRITICAL shell injection vulnerability in fortplot_security module
- [ ] #533: defect: multiple shell injection vulnerabilities remain after security PR
- [ ] #535: CRITICAL: Sprint claims vs reality - systematic failure across all deliverables
- [ ] #536: ARCHITECTURAL FAILURE: Team confused repository cleanup with module splitting
- [ ] #537: PROCESS FAILURE: False completion reporting undermines sprint integrity
- [ ] #538: COMPETENCY CRISIS: Team cannot execute even 3-issue simplified sprint

**FAILED PREVIOUS SPRINT ISSUES** (Claimed completed but verified as failures):
- [ ] #506: defect: multiple execute_command_line calls pose security risks (20 calls remain - LIED about elimination)
- [ ] #511: QADS Violation: fortplot_figure_core.f90 exceeds 1000-line limit (979 lines unchanged - LIED about splitting)
- [ ] #499: defect: binary executables and unreferenced files polluting repository (all files exist - LIED about cleanup)

**PREVIOUS ARCHITECTURAL DEFECTS** (Deferred due to demonstrated incompetence):
- [ ] #507: defect: unused fortplot_forensic_comparison module is dead code with security risks
- [ ] #504: defect: potential memory leaks and unsafe memory management patterns  
- [ ] #500: defect: 22 disabled test files indicate systematic test infrastructure failure
- [ ] #512: arch: inconsistent error handling patterns across backend modules
- [ ] #514: arch: module dependency cycles in figure subsystem
- [ ] #515: arch: inconsistent coordinate system handling across backends
- [ ] #513: arch: performance monitoring infrastructure gaps
- [ ] #509: Bug: add_3d_plot method documented but not implemented
- [ ] #510: Bug: errorbar documented as figure method but only available as global function
- [ ] #503: defect: build system artifacts and temporary files polluting repository
- [ ] #505: defect: 11 stub implementations indicate incomplete functionality
- [ ] #508: CRITICAL: Comprehensive PLAY audit findings consolidation - team documentation failures
- [ ] #415: Documentation Defects: Broken references, duplicated content, empty READMEs

**Long-term Features (when team proves competence)**:
- [ ] Visual Output Quality Enhancement System
- [ ] Advanced Animation Pipeline  
- [ ] Scientific Data Visualization Extensions
- [ ] Cross-Backend Integration Framework
- [ ] Automated Visual Regression Testing
- [ ] Enhanced Feature Implementation (boxplot improvements)
