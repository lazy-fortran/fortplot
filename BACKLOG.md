# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT: MERGE CONFLICTS AND CRITICAL DEFECTS RESOLUTION

**SPRINT GOAL**: RESOLVE MERGER CONFLICTS + RESTORE CORE FUNCTIONALITY - Address PR #690 merge conflicts blocking development while fixing 5 critical functionality breakdowns discovered in PLAY audit.

**PLAY AUDIT REVELATION**: Emergency Build System Restoration Sprint 100% SUCCESS but PLAY discovered 5 critical defects requiring immediate resolution before architectural work.

**PRIORITY BALANCE**: Merge conflict resolution (blocks work) + Critical defects (blocks users) + Manageable architectural progress.
