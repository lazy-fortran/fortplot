# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT: ARCHITECTURAL CONSOLIDATION CRISIS

**SPRINT GOAL**: Address unmanageable repository scale crisis that blocks all development progress - consolidate 116 source files to <50 files while maintaining functionality.

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (3 FOCUSED ITEMS - ARCHITECTURAL SCOPE)

### EPIC: SOURCE FILE CONSOLIDATION CRISIS

- [ ] #646: ARCHITECTURAL CRISIS - Consolidate 116 source files to <50 maximum (Repository unnavigable at current scale)
- [ ] #620: CRITICAL - Split fortplot_figure_core.f90 from 912 lines to <500 line modules (82% architectural violation)  
- [ ] #609: CI ENFORCEMENT - Establish automated file count limits to prevent re-accumulation (Technical enforcement gates)

## DOING (Current Work)

### ARCHITECTURAL CONSOLIDATION CRISIS SPRINT: ACTIVE

**SPRINT FOCUS**: Repository scale crisis blocks all development - 116 source files exceed management capacity by 331%

**CURRENT STATUS**: Planning phase complete, ready for implementation

**ARCHITECTURAL EVIDENCE**:
- **FILE COUNT CRISIS**: 116 source files (target: <50) - repository unnavigable
- **SIZE VIOLATIONS**: fortplot_figure_core.f90 at 912 lines (82% over 500-line limit)
- **DEVELOPMENT PARALYSIS**: Team cannot locate or modify files efficiently
- **MAINTENANCE CRISIS**: Code changes require searching through 100+ files

**CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY**:
1. **EPIC #646**: Systematic file consolidation by functional area (116→<50 files)
2. **EPIC #620**: Core module splitting (912→<500 lines per module)  
3. **EPIC #609**: Automated enforcement to prevent re-accumulation

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
- All consolidation MUST preserve existing functionality
- Test suite MUST pass after each consolidation step
- API compatibility MUST be maintained for user code
- Build system integration MUST remain functional

### Sprint Notes (ARCHITECTURAL CONSOLIDATION CRISIS)
- **REPOSITORY SCALE CRISIS**: 116 source files exceed management capacity by 331%
- **DEVELOPMENT PARALYSIS**: Team cannot efficiently locate or modify code
- **ARCHITECTURAL DEBT CRITICAL**: fortplot_figure_core.f90 at 912 lines (82% violation)
- **MAINTENANCE EMERGENCY**: Simple changes require searching 100+ files
- **CONSOLIDATION REQUIRED**: Must reduce to <50 files for sustainable development
- **FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVATION**: All consolidation must maintain API compatibility
- **AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT**: CI gates needed to prevent re-accumulation
- **STRATEGIC PRIORITY**: Repository organization over new features
- **DUPLICATE CLEANUP**: Issues #632, #647, #664 consolidated (technical verification)
- **TEAM FOCUS**: Architecture foundation required before feature development
