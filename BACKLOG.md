## CURRENT SPRINT (Architectural Debt Resolution)

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (Architectural Debt Resolution Sprint)


### EPIC: Technical Debt Resolution
- [ ] #428: defect: PLAY workflow audit summary - 13 defect categories found
- [ ] #479: refactor: optimize Greek letter mapping functions with lookup tables
- [ ] #480: enhance: add extended Greek Unicode ranges for complete scientific notation
- [ ] #481: refactor: extract common TDD test utilities to reduce duplication

### EPIC: Core API Stability Enhancement
- [ ] #421: defect: file I/O operations without proper validation
- [ ] #420: defect: potential memory leak - deallocate without error checking
- [ ] #429: Bug: Animation save implementation not initialized
- [ ] #427: defect: performance issues - large allocations and inefficient patterns
- [ ] #457: enhancement: complete matplotlib stub implementations
- [ ] #473: refactor: implement proper errorbar, bar, and scatter functionality
- [ ] #474: docs: add warnings for unimplemented matplotlib features
- [ ] #475: perf: optimize contour array conversion in matplotlib wrapper

### EPIC: Visual Output Quality Restoration
- [ ] #408: ASCII plots don't show full curves in basic plots
- [ ] #409: Limited height of ASCII plots in contour demo
- [ ] #413: title in png plots too far right
- [ ] #410: Format string markers (dashed, circles, x) completely non-functional
- [ ] #411: Axes and labels at wrong positions in scale examples
- [ ] #412: Streamplot demo too colorful

### EPIC: Enhanced Feature Implementation
- [ ] #451: refactor: replace bubble sort with efficient sorting in boxplot
- [ ] #452: feat: implement color parameter processing in boxplot method
- [ ] #453: fix: improve quartile calculation accuracy in boxplot

### EPIC: Documentation Quality Assurance
- [ ] #415: Documentation Defects: Broken references, duplicated content, empty READMEs
- [ ] #438: defect: Documentation consolidation for Critical Foundation Recovery Sprint
- [ ] #448: defect: Documentation consolidation for Foundation Quality Enforcement Sprint
- [ ] #471: defect: Documentation consolidation for Architectural Debt Resolution Sprint

## DOING (Current Work)
- [ ] #419: defect: magic numbers without named constants [EPIC: Technical Debt Resolution]

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (Long-term Features)

- [ ] Advanced Plotting Features Enhancement
- [ ] Cross-Backend Integration Framework
