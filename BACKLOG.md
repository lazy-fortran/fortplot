# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT (Critical Security and Architecture Recovery)

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (Critical Security and Architecture Recovery Sprint)

### EPIC: Critical Security Vulnerabilities (PRIORITY 1 - Blocking)
- [ ] #506: defect: multiple execute_command_line calls pose security risks
- [ ] #507: defect: unused fortplot_forensic_comparison module is dead code with security risks
- [ ] #504: defect: potential memory leaks and unsafe memory management patterns
- [ ] #500: defect: 22 disabled test files indicate systematic test infrastructure failure

### EPIC: QADS Critical Violations (PRIORITY 2 - Architecture)
- [ ] #511: QADS Violation: fortplot_figure_core.f90 exceeds 1000-line limit (979 lines)
- [ ] #512: arch: inconsistent error handling patterns across backend modules
- [ ] #514: arch: module dependency cycles in figure subsystem
- [ ] #515: arch: inconsistent coordinate system handling across backends
- [ ] #513: arch: performance monitoring infrastructure gaps
- [ ] #501: defect: potential circular dependency and architecture violations

### EPIC: API Documentation Mismatches (PRIORITY 3 - User-Facing)
- [ ] #509: Bug: add_3d_plot method documented but not implemented
- [ ] #510: Bug: errorbar documented as figure method but only available as global function
- [ ] #473: refactor: implement proper errorbar, bar, and scatter functionality
- [ ] #474: docs: add warnings for unimplemented matplotlib features

### EPIC: Code Quality and Cleanup (PRIORITY 4 - Technical Debt)
- [ ] #499: defect: binary executables and unreferenced files polluting repository
- [ ] #503: defect: build system artifacts and temporary files polluting repository
- [ ] #502: defect: code duplication and inconsistent error handling patterns
- [ ] #505: defect: 11 stub implementations indicate incomplete functionality
- [ ] #481: refactor: extract common TDD test utilities to reduce duplication

### EPIC: Performance and Memory Optimization (PRIORITY 5 - Performance)
- [ ] #427: defect: performance issues - large allocations and inefficient patterns
- [ ] #479: refactor: optimize Greek letter mapping functions with lookup tables
- [ ] #475: perf: optimize contour array conversion in matplotlib wrapper
- [ ] #420: defect: potential memory leak - deallocate without error checking

### EPIC: Documentation Consolidation (PRIORITY 6 - Final)
- [ ] #516: defect: documentation consolidation for Architectural Debt Resolution Sprint
- [ ] #508: defect: comprehensive PLAY audit findings - 8 major defect categories identified
- [ ] #415: Documentation Defects: Broken references, duplicated content, empty READMEs

## DOING (Current Work)

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (Long-term Features)

- [ ] Visual Output Quality Enhancement System
- [ ] Advanced Animation Pipeline
- [ ] Scientific Data Visualization Extensions
- [ ] Cross-Backend Integration Framework
- [ ] Automated Visual Regression Testing
- [ ] Enhanced Feature Implementation (boxplot improvements)

## DONE
- [x] Repository Management and Branch Protection Recovery
- [x] PLAY Workflow Defect Discovery System
- [x] Critical Foundation Recovery (Partial - 40% achieved)
- [x] Core Segfault Resolution and State Management
- [x] Foundation Quality Enforcement (85% Success - Major quality gates, infrastructure, API reliability, visual output achieved)
- [x] Module Architecture Refactoring (100% Success - All QADS line limits achieved, complexity distributed, duplicate types eliminated)
- [x] Architectural Debt Resolution Sprint (90% Success - Major architectural violations resolved, quality foundation maintained)
