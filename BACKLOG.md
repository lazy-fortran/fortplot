# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT (SECURITY & CORE FUNCTIONALITY - 5 Issues)

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (SECURITY FIRST - Eliminate Vulnerabilities & Restore Core)

**FOCUS**: Security vulnerabilities discovered DURING security fix. This incompetence ends NOW. Fix security FIRST, then core functionality.

### EPIC: SECURITY ELIMINATION
- [ ] #541: CRITICAL: Security module USES execute_command_line instead of eliminating it

### EPIC: TEST INTEGRITY
- [ ] #585: CRITICAL: Test fabrication - 7 fake EXPECTED FAILURE tests

### EPIC: CORE FUNCTIONALITY RESTORATION
- [ ] #577: CRITICAL: PNG backend has 100x dimension calculation error
- [ ] #575: CRITICAL: Python bridge executable not in PATH - Python integration broken

## DOING (Current Work)

### EPIC: SECURITY ELIMINATION
- [ ] #581: CRITICAL: C code still contains system() and popen() command injection vectors

### Sprint Notes
- **SECURITY FIRST**: Issues #581 and #541 are CRITICAL - command injection vectors must be eliminated
- **COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT**: Check ALL files in ALL languages - team created vulnerabilities while fixing them
- **VERIFICATION REQUIRED**: Every fix must be verified with security audit before marking complete
- **NO SHORTCUTS**: Replace system calls with secure alternatives, not just input validation
- **USER VALUE**: PNG (#577) and Python (#575) unlock 80% of functionality after security fixed

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (CONSOLIDATED DEFECT REPOSITORY)

**CRITICAL DEFECTS** (Next Sprint Priority):
- [ ] #531: DEFECT: Security changes broke 8+ example directories - GitHub Pages visual showcase damaged
- [ ] #569: FUNCTIONALITY DESTROYED: ImageMagick disabled breaking visual processing capabilities
- [ ] #530: DEFECT: Catastrophic performance regression - 800+ identical warnings spam console
- [ ] #524: DEFECT: Issue #511 QADS file splitting violation remains completely unfixed

**PROCESS DEFECTS**:
- [ ] #562: PROCESS VIOLATION: PR #560 BACKLOG.md status inconsistent with completion claims

**TECHNICAL DEFECTS** (Deferred Until Trust Restored):
- [ ] #548: defect: Duplicate directory creation functions across modules
- [ ] #553: DEFECT: GitHub Pages visual showcase system degraded by missing README files
- [ ] #499: defect: binary executables and unreferenced files polluting repository (limited cleanup only)

**PREVIOUS ARCHITECTURAL DEFECTS** (Deferred due to trust restoration focus):
- [ ] #507: defect: unused fortplot_forensic_comparison module is dead code with security risks
- [ ] #504: defect: potential memory leaks and unsafe memory management patterns  
- [ ] #500: defect: 22 disabled test files indicate systematic test infrastructure failure
- [ ] #512: arch: inconsistent error handling patterns across backend modules
- [ ] #514: arch: module dependency cycles in figure subsystem
- [ ] #515: arch: inconsistent coordinate system handling across backends
- [ ] #513: arch: performance monitoring infrastructure gaps
- [ ] #509: Bug: add_3d_plot method documented but not implemented
- [ ] #510: Bug: errorbar documented as figure method but only available as global function
- [ ] #503: defect: build system artifacts and temporary files polluting repository
- [ ] #505: defect: 11 stub implementations indicate incomplete functionality
- [ ] #508: CRITICAL: Comprehensive PLAY audit findings consolidation - team documentation failures
- [ ] #415: Documentation Defects: Broken references, duplicated content, empty READMEs

**Long-term Features (when trust restored)**:
- [ ] Visual Output Quality Enhancement System
- [ ] Advanced Animation Pipeline  
- [ ] Scientific Data Visualization Extensions
- [ ] Cross-Backend Integration Framework
- [ ] Automated Visual Regression Testing
- [ ] Enhanced Feature Implementation (boxplot improvements)
