# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT: ARCHITECTURAL CONSOLIDATION CRISIS 

**SPRINT GOAL**: EMERGENCY REPOSITORY CONSOLIDATION - Reduce 121 source files to sustainable architectural limit of 50 files maximum. Repository complexity crisis revealed by successful emergency sprint.

**CRISIS DISCOVERY**: Emergency Build System Restoration Sprint SUCCESS revealed repository has exceeded maintainable complexity - 121 files caused compilation fragility requiring emergency intervention.

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (ARCHITECTURAL CONSOLIDATION FOCUS)

### EPIC: REPOSITORY SCALE CRISIS RESOLUTION

- [ ] #699: ARCHITECTURAL CRISIS - Repository complexity exceeds maintainable limits (121→50 files maximum)
- [ ] #700: TECHNICAL DEBT - File size violations persist despite modular refactoring success

## DOING (Current Work)

**ARCHITECTURAL CONSOLIDATION SPRINT PLANNING**

**CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY**:
- Apply proven modular refactoring success pattern repository-wide
- Reduce 121 source files to architectural maximum of 50 files  
- Eliminate module interface chaos causing compilation emergencies
- Establish build system resilience for routine architectural changes

**PROVEN CAPABILITIES FROM EMERGENCY SPRINT**:
- ✅ Team demonstrated modular architecture competence
- ✅ Successfully managed complex module interfaces when scope controlled
- ✅ Effective breakdown of monolithic core (fortplot_figure_core.f90)
- ✅ Build system restoration through architectural discipline

**EVIDENCE OF CRISIS**: Emergency compilation fixes were SYMPTOM of architectural scale crisis - repository complexity exceeded team maintenance capacity

**EMERGENCY REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED**:
- **COMPILATION MUST WORK**: Users cannot build ANY fortplot programs - critical business failure
- **EXAMPLES MUST COMPILE**: README examples fail with interface errors - documentation fraud
- **API FUNCTIONALITY REQUIRED**: Object-oriented API broken - core user interface destroyed
- **DOCUMENTATION BUILD REQUIRED**: Build system completely non-functional
- **USER HARM PREVENTION**: Focus exclusively on restoring working functionality
- **DEVELOPMENT MORATORIUM**: No new features until basic functionality restored

**BUILD RESTORATION STRATEGY**:
1. **EPIC #680**: Emergency compilation system diagnosis and restoration
2. **EPIC #683**: Example compilation fixes with proper interface resolution
3. **EPIC #684**: Object-oriented API restoration for user code compatibility

**EMERGENCY TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
- Build system MUST compile basic fortplot programs (verified by make build)
- Examples MUST compile successfully (verified by make example)
- Object-oriented API MUST work with user code (verified by README examples)
- Documentation build MUST generate user-accessible docs (verified by make doc)
- Interface resolution MUST be working correctly (verified by compilation tests)
- NO NEW FEATURES until basic functionality restored
- All completion claims MUST be verified with working compilation evidence

### Sprint Notes (EMERGENCY BUILD SYSTEM RESTORATION)
- **CRITICAL BUSINESS FAILURE**: Users cannot compile ANY fortplot programs - emergency priority
- **BUILD SYSTEM BROKEN**: Compilation failures block all user workflows
- **INTERFACE ERRORS**: Examples fail with interface resolution problems
- **API DESTRUCTION**: Object-oriented interface from README documentation non-functional
- **DOCUMENTATION FAILURE**: Build system cannot generate user-accessible documentation
- **DEVELOPMENT MORATORIUM**: No architectural work until compilation works
- **FRAUD PREVENTION**: All completion claims require working compilation evidence
- **USER-FIRST PRIORITY**: Restore user functionality before any internal improvements
- **EMERGENCY PROTOCOL**: Maximum oversight and verification for all completion claims
- **TECHNICAL ENFORCEMENT**: CI gates prevent merge until compilation verified
