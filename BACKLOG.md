# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT (FUNCTIONALITY RECOVERY - 5 Issues)

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (USER VALUE RECOVERY - Restore Core Functionality)

**FOCUS**: Restore basic user functionality by fixing the highest-impact blockers that prevent ALL users from getting value.

### EPIC: PYTHON INTEGRATION RECOVERY
- [ ] #584: CRITICAL: Python API completely broken - dependency hallucination
- [ ] #575: CRITICAL: Python bridge executable not in PATH - Python integration broken

### EPIC: VISUAL OUTPUT RECOVERY  
- [ ] #577: CRITICAL: PNG backend has 100x dimension calculation error
- [ ] #569: FUNCTIONALITY DESTROYED: ImageMagick disabled breaking visual processing capabilities

### EPIC: QUALITY FOUNDATION
- [ ] #585: CRITICAL: Test fabrication - 7 fake EXPECTED FAILURE tests

## DOING (Current Work)

*Sprint ready to begin - focus on maximum user value delivery*

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (CONSOLIDATED DEFECT REPOSITORY)

**CRITICAL DEFECTS** (Next Sprint Priority):
- [ ] #577: CRITICAL: PNG backend has 100x dimension calculation error
- [ ] #575: CRITICAL: Python bridge executable not in PATH - Python integration broken
- [ ] #569: FUNCTIONALITY DESTROYED: ImageMagick disabled breaking visual processing capabilities
- [ ] #578: ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER: 119 files in src/ directory violates limits

**PROCESS DEFECTS**:
- [ ] #562: PROCESS VIOLATION: PR #560 BACKLOG.md status inconsistent with completion claims

**TECHNICAL DEFECTS** (Deferred Until Trust Restored):
- [ ] #548: defect: Duplicate directory creation functions across modules
- [ ] #553: DEFECT: GitHub Pages visual showcase system degraded by missing README files
- [ ] #499: defect: binary executables and unreferenced files polluting repository (limited cleanup only)

**PREVIOUS ARCHITECTURAL DEFECTS** (Deferred due to trust restoration focus):
- [ ] #507: defect: unused fortplot_forensic_comparison module is dead code with security risks
- [ ] #504: defect: potential memory leaks and unsafe memory management patterns  
- [ ] #500: defect: 22 disabled test files indicate systematic test infrastructure failure
- [ ] #512: arch: inconsistent error handling patterns across backend modules
- [ ] #514: arch: module dependency cycles in figure subsystem
- [ ] #515: arch: inconsistent coordinate system handling across backends
- [ ] #513: arch: performance monitoring infrastructure gaps
- [ ] #509: Bug: add_3d_plot method documented but not implemented
- [ ] #510: Bug: errorbar documented as figure method but only available as global function
- [ ] #503: defect: build system artifacts and temporary files polluting repository
- [ ] #505: defect: 11 stub implementations indicate incomplete functionality
- [ ] #508: CRITICAL: Comprehensive PLAY audit findings consolidation - team documentation failures
- [ ] #415: Documentation Defects: Broken references, duplicated content, empty READMEs

**Long-term Features (when trust restored)**:
- [ ] Visual Output Quality Enhancement System
- [ ] Advanced Animation Pipeline  
- [ ] Scientific Data Visualization Extensions
- [ ] Cross-Backend Integration Framework
- [ ] Automated Visual Regression Testing
- [ ] Enhanced Feature Implementation (boxplot improvements)
