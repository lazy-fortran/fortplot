# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT: EMERGENCY USER FUNCTIONALITY RECOVERY

**SPRINT GOAL**: Restore basic user functionality destroyed by team's incompetent "security improvements". Focus ONLY on user value - no more architectural experiments.

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (USER FUNCTIONALITY EMERGENCY)

**TEAM FAILURE CONTEXT**: Previous sprint created 9 new critical issues while claiming security improvements. Net negative progress demonstrates dangerous incompetence.

### EPIC: CRITICAL USER FUNCTIONALITY RESTORATION (3 Items Maximum)
- [ ] #598: CRITICAL: PNG backend 100x dimension overflow regression - 80% of users blocked
- [ ] #599: CRITICAL: Python bridge executable hangs indefinitely - Python integration destroyed  
- [ ] #600: CRITICAL: pcolormesh functionality completely broken - scientific visualization destroyed

## DOING (Current Work)

**NO ACTIVE WORK** - Emergency sprint planning in progress.

### Sprint Notes (USER FUNCTIONALITY EMERGENCY)
- **COMPETENCE CRISIS**: Team created 9 new critical issues while claiming "fixes" 
- **TRUST DESTROYED**: All prior completion claims proved false - independent verification mandatory
- **USER FIRST**: No architectural work until user functionality restored  
- **MAXIMUM 3 ITEMS**: Team incapable of handling more than 3 simple tasks
- **DIRECT OVERSIGHT**: chris reviews ALL work before any PR creation

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (CONSOLIDATED DEFECT REPOSITORY)

**TEAM-CREATED SECURITY DISASTERS** (Fix After User Functionality Restored):
- [ ] #592: CRITICAL: Memory leak in secure_exec strdup calls allows DoS attacks (team created)
- [ ] #593: CRITICAL: Windows command injection vulnerability in secure_exec quote handling (team created)  
- [ ] #597: CRITICAL: Potential deadlock in Windows secure_close_pipe with INFINITE timeout (team created)
- [ ] #595: CRITICAL: Massive directory size violation - src/ has 114 files (team created)
- [ ] #596: CRITICAL: Massive code duplication across 9 files for command checking (team created)
- [ ] #594: MAJOR: fortplot_secure_exec.c exceeds 500-line size target (team created)

**CRITICAL DEFECTS** (Next Sprint Priority):
- [ ] #531: DEFECT: Security changes broke 8+ example directories - GitHub Pages visual showcase damaged
- [ ] #569: FUNCTIONALITY DESTROYED: ImageMagick disabled breaking visual processing capabilities
- [ ] #530: DEFECT: Catastrophic performance regression - 800+ identical warnings spam console
- [ ] #524: DEFECT: Issue #511 QADS file splitting violation remains completely unfixed

**PROCESS DEFECTS**:
- [ ] #562: PROCESS VIOLATION: PR #560 BACKLOG.md status inconsistent with completion claims

**TECHNICAL DEFECTS** (Deferred Until Trust Restored):
- [ ] #548: defect: Duplicate directory creation functions across modules
- [ ] #553: DEFECT: GitHub Pages visual showcase system degraded by missing README files
- [ ] #499: defect: binary executables and unreferenced files polluting repository (limited cleanup only)

**PREVIOUS ARCHITECTURAL DEFECTS** (Deferred due to trust restoration focus):
- [ ] #507: defect: unused fortplot_forensic_comparison module is dead code with security risks
- [ ] #504: defect: potential memory leaks and unsafe memory management patterns  
- [ ] #500: defect: 22 disabled test files indicate systematic test infrastructure failure
- [ ] #512: arch: inconsistent error handling patterns across backend modules
- [ ] #514: arch: module dependency cycles in figure subsystem
- [ ] #515: arch: inconsistent coordinate system handling across backends
- [ ] #513: arch: performance monitoring infrastructure gaps
- [ ] #509: Bug: add_3d_plot method documented but not implemented
- [ ] #510: Bug: errorbar documented as figure method but only available as global function
- [ ] #503: defect: build system artifacts and temporary files polluting repository
- [ ] #505: defect: 11 stub implementations indicate incomplete functionality
- [ ] #508: CRITICAL: Comprehensive PLAY audit findings consolidation - team documentation failures
- [ ] #415: Documentation Defects: Broken references, duplicated content, empty READMEs

**Long-term Features (when trust restored)**:
- [ ] Visual Output Quality Enhancement System
- [ ] Advanced Animation Pipeline  
- [ ] Scientific Data Visualization Extensions
- [ ] Cross-Backend Integration Framework
- [ ] Automated Visual Regression Testing
- [ ] Enhanced Feature Implementation (boxplot improvements)
