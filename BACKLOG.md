# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT: ARCHITECTURAL CONSOLIDATION CRISIS

**SPRINT GOAL**: Address repository organizational crisis through structural improvements and dead code elimination with ZERO functionality loss - focus on directory hierarchy and code quality over file count metrics.

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (3 FOCUSED ITEMS - ARCHITECTURAL SCOPE)

### EPIC: STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION IMPROVEMENT

- [x] #646: DIRECTORY HIERARCHY - Create logical directory structure within src/ for better navigation and understanding
- [ ] #620: DEAD CODE ELIMINATION - Scan for and eliminate unused/dead code with evidence-based analysis
- [ ] #609: FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVATION - Ensure all tests and examples work before and after reorganization

## DOING (Current Work)

### ARCHITECTURAL CONSOLIDATION CRISIS SPRINT: ACTIVE

**SPRINT FOCUS**: Repository structural improvement with ZERO functionality loss - directory organization and dead code elimination

**CURRENT STATUS**: Sprint started on main branch, ready for implementation

**USER REQUIREMENTS INCORPORATED**:
- **NO FUNCTIONALITY LOSS**: Absolutely zero functionality must be lost during consolidation
- **PRESERVE ALL TESTS**: Test coverage cannot decrease - all tests must be maintained
- **PRESERVE ALL EXAMPLES**: All examples must continue working after consolidation
- **DIRECTORY HIERARCHY**: Create good directory structure within src/ for navigation
- **DEAD CODE SCANNING**: Evidence-based scanning and elimination of unused code
- **STRUCTURAL FOCUS**: Improve organization and understanding, not just file count

**REORGANIZATION STRATEGY**:
1. **EPIC #646**: Directory hierarchy creation within src/ for logical organization
2. **EPIC #620**: Evidence-based dead code identification and elimination
3. **EPIC #609**: Comprehensive verification that all functionality is preserved

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS** (USER MANDATED):
- ALL consolidation MUST preserve existing functionality (ZERO loss)
- ALL tests MUST be maintained (no test coverage decrease)
- ALL examples MUST continue working (verified by make example)
- API backward compatibility MUST be maintained for user code
- Directory structure MUST improve navigation and understanding
- Dead code elimination MUST be evidence-based (not speculative)
- Build system integration MUST remain functional

### Sprint Notes (STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION IMPROVEMENT)
- **USER MANDATE**: Zero functionality loss - all tests and examples must be preserved
- **DIRECTORY HIERARCHY**: Create logical organization within src/ for better navigation
- **DEAD CODE FOCUS**: Evidence-based scanning and elimination of unused code
- **STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENT**: Focus on organization and understanding, not just metrics
- **COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION**: All functionality must be verified before and after
- **TEST COVERAGE PRESERVATION**: No decrease in test coverage - all tests maintained
- **EXAMPLE PRESERVATION**: All examples must compile and run successfully
- **BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: API must remain fully compatible for user code
- **EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH**: All dead code elimination must be based on proof
- **STRATEGIC FOCUS**: Structural quality over file count reduction
