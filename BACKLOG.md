# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT: FRAUD-PROOF QUALITY FOUNDATION

**SPRINT GOAL**: Address 4 new CRITICAL defects discovered in PLAY audit that expose systematic fraud and establish fraud-proof quality gates to prevent regression.

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (3 ITEMS MAX - POST-FRAUD TEAM LIMIT)

### EPIC: FRAUD-PROOF QUALITY ENFORCEMENT

- [DOING] #645: CRITICAL - Zero test coverage on 335 new code lines in PR #642 (BLOCKS MERGE)
- [ ] #647: SECURITY AUDIT - 26 files contain dangerous system execution calls despite hardening claims  
- [ ] #648: TECHNICAL DEBT - 38 TODO/FIXME/HACK markers indicate systematic incomplete work

## DOING (Current Work)

### EPIC: FRAUD-PROOF QUALITY ENFORCEMENT (Ready for Sprint Start)

**REPOSITORY STATUS AFTER PR RESOLUTION**:
- [x] PR #644: MERGED - Artifact pollution eliminated (CI VERIFIED: ALL CHECKS PASSED)
- [ ] PR #643: HANDBACK - 76 lines uncovered, comprehensive tests required  
- [ ] PR #642: HANDBACK - 335 lines uncovered + size violations, coverage crisis

**READY FOR SPRINT_BACKLOG WORK**: All blocking PRs resolved, development workflow unblocked

### DOING: Issue #645 - CRITICAL Test Coverage Crisis (PR #642)

**MOVED FROM SPRINT_BACKLOG**: Issue #645 now in implementation phase
**CONTEXT**: PR #642 has 335 lines of uncovered code requiring comprehensive testing
**EPIC**: FRAUD-PROOF QUALITY ENFORCEMENT (1 of 3 items)

### Sprint Notes (FRAUD-PROOF QUALITY FOUNDATION)
- **PLAY AUDIT DISCOVERY**: SYSTEMATIC FRAUD CONFIRMED - false completion claims across ALL 3 previous sprint items
- **NEW CRITICAL DEFECTS**: 4 issues (#645, #646, #647, #648) reveal quality deterioration despite completion claims
- **ZERO TRUST MODE**: All previous completions suspect - require independent technical verification  
- **TEST COVERAGE CRISIS**: PR #642 has 0% coverage on 335 lines - fundamental quality gate failure
- **ARCHITECTURAL COLLAPSE**: 116 source files (331% over target) - repository unnavigable
- **SECURITY REGRESSION**: 26 files still contain dangerous calls after "security hardening"
- **TECHNICAL DEBT EXPLOSION**: 38 markers indicate systematic incomplete implementations
- **FRAUD-PROOF ENFORCEMENT**: CI gates, automated verification, independent testing required
