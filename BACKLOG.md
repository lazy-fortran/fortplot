# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT: EMERGENCY REPOSITORY RECOVERY

**SPRINT GOAL**: CRISIS RECOVERY - Restore basic repository functionality after catastrophic consolidation failure. Repository is 100% unbuildable blocking all development.

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (2 ITEMS MAX - EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS)

### EPIC: EMERGENCY BUILD SYSTEM RECOVERY

## DOING (Current Work)

### #633: EMERGENCY - Repository completely unbuildable - immediate recovery required
**EPIC**: EMERGENCY BUILD SYSTEM RECOVERY  
**STATUS**: IN PROGRESS - Fix broken module references from failed PR #629 consolidation
**CRITICAL**: make test fails immediately - 100% development blockage

### Sprint Notes (EMERGENCY COMPETENCE CRISIS PROTOCOLS)
- **REPOSITORY DISASTER**: PR #629 claimed consolidation success while breaking build system 100%
- **SYSTEMATIC LYING**: Team pattern of false completion claims while leaving broken repositories
- **TRUST OBLITERATED**: Cannot trust any completion claims without independent verification
- **BUILD SYSTEM DESTROYED**: make test fails immediately - cannot run any tests or validation
- **COMPETENCE EMERGENCY**: Team demonstrates dangerous incompetence requiring external oversight
- **MAXIMUM 2 ITEMS**: Further reduction after catastrophic consolidation failure
- **MANDATORY VERIFICATION**: make test must pass before claiming ANY progress
- **BRUTAL REALITY**: Repository state is worse than before "architectural improvements"

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (CONSOLIDATED DEFECT REPOSITORY)

**EMERGENCY RECOVERY BACKLOG** (After Build System Restored):
- [ ] #634: EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS - Team competence crisis requires immediate intervention
- [ ] #630: CRITICAL - Fix incomplete consolidation module migration (fortplot_utils missing)
- [ ] #631: DEFECT - 9 files still exceed 500-line limits after "consolidation"
- [ ] #632: SECURITY - 245+ system/exec calls persist despite security sprint claims

**DEFERRED TECHNICAL DEFECTS** (After Repository Reduction):
- [ ] #618: SECURITY - system/popen calls in 8 files require secure replacement
- [ ] #608: CONSOLIDATION - Python interface duplicate files (branch management approach)
- [ ] #613: CI BLOCKER - CMAKE test obsolete after cleanup blocks PRs

**EMERGENCY DEFECT ELIMINATION SPRINT - MIXED SUCCESS** (Tactical Success, Strategic Failure):
- [x] #617: File size analysis - COMPLETED (analysis only, NO implementation, critical issues remain)
- [x] #616: Test failures - COMPLETED (antialiasing and blocking tests resolved)
- [x] #615: Artifact cleanup - PARTIAL (129 deleted but 117 still remain in root)
- [x] #605: Test consolidation - COMPLETED (PR #612: 9→2 files, 1,214→948 lines)

**USER FUNCTIONALITY DISASTERS** (Next Sprint After Repository Reduction):
- [ ] #598: CRITICAL: PNG backend 100x dimension overflow regression - 80% of users blocked
- [ ] #599: CRITICAL: Python bridge executable hangs indefinitely - Python integration destroyed  
- [ ] #600: CRITICAL: pcolormesh functionality completely broken - scientific visualization destroyed

**TEAM-CREATED SECURITY DISASTERS** (Fix After Repository Reduction):
- [ ] #592: CRITICAL: Memory leak in secure_exec strdup calls allows DoS attacks (team created)
- [ ] #593: CRITICAL: Windows command injection vulnerability in secure_exec quote handling (team created)  
- [ ] #597: CRITICAL: Potential deadlock in Windows secure_close_pipe with INFINITE timeout (team created)
- [ ] #595: CRITICAL: Massive directory size violation - src/ has 114 files (team created)
- [ ] #596: CRITICAL: Massive code duplication across 9 files for command checking (team created)
- [ ] #594: MAJOR: fortplot_secure_exec.c exceeds 500-line size target (team created)

**REMAINING REPOSITORY REDUCTION TASKS** (Phase 2):
- [ ] #606: CRITICAL: Consolidate 9 fortplot_doc modules into 3 files maximum - eliminate module sprawl
- [ ] #609: CRITICAL: Establish file count limits and CI enforcement to prevent re-accumulation

**CRITICAL DEFECTS** (Next Sprint Priority):
- [ ] #531: DEFECT: Security changes broke 8+ example directories - GitHub Pages visual showcase damaged
- [ ] #569: FUNCTIONALITY DESTROYED: ImageMagick disabled breaking visual processing capabilities
- [ ] #530: DEFECT: Catastrophic performance regression - 800+ identical warnings spam console
- [ ] #524: DEFECT: Issue #511 QADS file splitting violation remains completely unfixed

**PROCESS DEFECTS**:
- [ ] #562: PROCESS VIOLATION: PR #560 BACKLOG.md status inconsistent with completion claims

**TECHNICAL DEFECTS** (Deferred Until Trust Restored):
- [ ] #548: defect: Duplicate directory creation functions across modules
- [ ] #553: DEFECT: GitHub Pages visual showcase system degraded by missing README files
- [ ] #499: defect: binary executables and unreferenced files polluting repository (limited cleanup only)

**PREVIOUS ARCHITECTURAL DEFECTS** (Deferred due to trust restoration focus):
- [ ] #507: defect: unused fortplot_forensic_comparison module is dead code with security risks
- [ ] #504: defect: potential memory leaks and unsafe memory management patterns  
- [ ] #500: defect: 22 disabled test files indicate systematic test infrastructure failure
- [ ] #512: arch: inconsistent error handling patterns across backend modules
- [ ] #514: arch: module dependency cycles in figure subsystem
- [ ] #515: arch: inconsistent coordinate system handling across backends
- [ ] #513: arch: performance monitoring infrastructure gaps
- [ ] #509: Bug: add_3d_plot method documented but not implemented
- [ ] #510: Bug: errorbar documented as figure method but only available as global function
- [ ] #503: defect: build system artifacts and temporary files polluting repository
- [ ] #505: defect: 11 stub implementations indicate incomplete functionality
- [ ] #508: CRITICAL: Comprehensive PLAY audit findings consolidation - team documentation failures
- [ ] #415: Documentation Defects: Broken references, duplicated content, empty READMEs

**Long-term Features (when trust restored)**:
- [ ] Visual Output Quality Enhancement System
- [ ] Advanced Animation Pipeline  
- [ ] Scientific Data Visualization Extensions
- [ ] Cross-Backend Integration Framework
