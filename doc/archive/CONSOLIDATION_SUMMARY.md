# Documentation Consolidation Summary

This file is a short historical note for Issue #271, which focused on reducing
duplicated documentation.

## Outcome

- Keep example documentation next to the example sources in
  `example/fortran/*/README.md`.
- Use the FORD documentation under `doc/` for navigation and focused guides,
  rather than duplicating every example README.
- Avoid tooling that generates large duplicate markdown trees.
