# fortplot Examples Gallery

This gallery lists the example pages generated from `example/fortran`. Each page
links to the source and shows the generated outputs.

The sections below are generated automatically from the example
directories tracked in `example/fortran`. Any new example folder will be
listed here the next time the documentation is rebuilt.
