module fortplot_global
    !! Global figure instance management for fortplot
    !! Provides access to the shared global figure used by pyplot-style functions
    !!
    !! This module separates the global figure instance management from the
    !! matplotlib-compatibility wrapper functions, allowing clean access to
    !! the global figure from different parts of the library.
